# xPong
A simple implementation of pong using X11.  
# Background
I've been interested in getting into game development for a while and figured making a basic pong game in C.
#How to use
Clone the repository and compile using the makefile.  cygwin users will need to invoke `startxwin ./xPong` to start the game.
